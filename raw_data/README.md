# Weird Looking Data

Okay so here me out, this is the data I cURLed from the website, I know it looks a little funky. Here's how the columns are aligned:

<ol>
   <li>Year</li>
   <li>Month</li>
   <li>Day</li>
   <li>Time</li>
   <li>Which Storm it is in the given year</li>
   <li>Name of the storm, if it has one (note that the space makes this take up two columns)</li>
   <li>Latitude</li>
   <li>Longitude (or 360 - longitude maybe)</li>
   <li>Wind Speed</li>
   <li>Whether it was on US soil</li>
</ol>
